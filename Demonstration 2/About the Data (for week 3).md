# AI Declaration

## Tools Used
- ChatGPT (for explanations and troubleshooting in KNIME)

## Prompts Used
- Which chart should I use?

## How AI Output Was Used
The AI helped me understand what the problem is in the question, and recommended the needed nodes that I use for grouping the data, then the suitable charts if I did not figure out which chart to use.

## Modifications Made
The AI really helped me a lot with the idea, but from that it needs a lot of modification. I have to try different nodes in order to choose the best one, and also for the charts in Knime

## Reflection
In short, ChatGPT helped me save time and get a better understanding and more recommendations as well as the methods and approaches to a problem.

## Acknowledgment
This report was created with assistance from Generative AI tools, but all analysis and interpretation were completed by me.
